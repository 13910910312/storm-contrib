storm-kafka provides a TransactionalSpout implementation for Apache Kafka 0.6. TransactionalSpout won't be available in Storm until 0.7.0 (a development release is currently available though). This implementation has only been lightly tested.

storm-kafka is available from Maven [here](http://clojars.org/storm/storm-kafka)
